# Welcome to EXO!

EXO is my first real world website made from a psd mockup (www.behance.net/gallery/37061865/Freebie-EXO-One-page-PSD-Theme, credits go to Arup Haldar).

# Summary

Building this website was quite a challenge as it involved learning some new things. One of them was working with Sass, a CSS preprocessor. One thing to notice is that selector nesting can be tempting, but it causes lots of trouble down the road. I also enjoyed having the chance to build my own seamlessly working menu. The hardest part - lazy loading with JS, since it was a new concept for me.
